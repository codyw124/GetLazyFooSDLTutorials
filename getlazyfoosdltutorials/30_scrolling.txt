Up until now we've only been deal with levels the size of the screen. With scrolling you can navigate through levels of any size by rendering everything relative to a camera.
The basic principle of scrolling is that you have a rectangle that functions as a camera:
And then you only render what's in the camera, which usually involves rendering things relative to the camera or only showing portions of objects inside the camera.
Since the level is no longer the size of the screen we have to have a separate set of constants to define the level size.
This time the dot has to render relative to the camera, so its rendering function takes in a camera position.
This time when moving the dot, we check if the dot moved off the level as opposed to checking if it moved off the screen since the screen is going to move around the level.
Now when we render objects to the screen, we render them relative to the camera by subtracting the camera offset.
Before we go into the main loop, we declare the dot and the camera that is going to be following it.
After we move the dot, we want to change the camera position to center over it. We don't want the camera to go outside of the level so we keep it in bounds after moving it.
After the camera is in place we render the portion of the background that is inside that camera and then render the dot relative to the camera position.
