Now that we know how to how to use joysticks with SDL, we can now use the new haptics API to make the controller shake.
A haptic device is something that gives some sort of physical feedback. In this case, it makes the controller rumble. The datatype for a haptics device is intuitively namedSDL_haptic.
Like with the joysticks subsystem, you need to make sure to initialize the haptic specific subsystem in order to use haptics.
After we initialize the joystick, we need to get the haptics device from the joystick usingSDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick on an opened joystick. If we manage to get the haptic device fromcontroller we have to initialize the rumble using SDL_HapticRumbleInit.
Once we're done with a haptic device, we call SDL_HapticClose.
To actually make the controller rumble, you need to make it play some sort of rumbling. The easiest way to make your controller shake is by callingSDL_HapticRumblePlay, which takes in the haptic device, strength in percentage, and duration of the rumble.Here we make the controller rumble at 75% strength for half a second whenever a SDL_JoyButtonEvent happens.

Now the SDL 2 haptics API has many more features not covered here including making custom effects, handling multi rumble devices, and handling haptic mice. You can check them outin the SDL 2 force feedback documentation.
