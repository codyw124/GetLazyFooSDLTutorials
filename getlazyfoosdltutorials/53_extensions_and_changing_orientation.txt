Now that we got SDL_image loading PNGs, it's time to handle when our mobile device rotates.
For this application we'll be having a different textures render depending on whether the device is in portrait or landscape mode.
When you rotate your device, the height/width of the window changes which means the window size changes. In order to support rotation, the window needs to be created as resizable.
SDL2 turns orientation change events into window change events. We check for window events and if the window event is a size change, we get the new dimensions, and update the screen.
How do we tell if the device is in portrait or landscape? Simple: if the height is greater width, it's in portrait. Otherwise, it's in landscape.
